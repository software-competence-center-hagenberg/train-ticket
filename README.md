#### Notes
Works as described, the displayed error message ist *result.trainFoodList is null*. In the other branches, where
this error is not implemented, a different error message is displayed (something like: *Could not find tripId*)

This error only affects the selection of food meals ordered/consumed on the train. Ordering food at a station is still
valid.

Trains where the injected fault can be observed: ZhiDa, TeKuai
