#### Notes

Works mostly as described. The default upload limit is 100Kb in `ts-admin-route-service: application.yml`, which causes an
HTML 500 error. There is a second upload limit of 1MB enforced by `ts-ui-dashboard`, the nginx webserver. This second
upload limit is the default for the nginx webserver.

In the top level of the project directory there is an example file, which can be used for testing. To test the file limit the existing entries
can be copied to inflate the file size. The file contains the following entries:

````csv
shanghai&taiyuan&shanghai,nanjing,shijiazhuang,taiyuan&0,350,1000,1300
shanghai&taiyuan&shanghai,nanjing,shijiazhuang,taiyuan&0,350,1000,1400
shanghai&taiyuan&shanghai,nanjing,shijiazhuang,taiyuan&0,350,1000,1500
shanghai&taiyuan&shanghai,nanjing,shijiazhuang,taiyuan&0,350,1000,1600
shanghai&taiyuan&shanghai,nanjing,shijiazhuang,taiyuan&0,350,1000,1700

The difference to the fault implemented in `ts-error-F15` lies in the location where the failure is triggered and
in the upload limit. In `ts-error-F15` the failure always triggers in `ts-ui-dashboard` (the nginx webserver), in
`ts-error-F16` it can be triggered by either `ts-ui-dashboard` or `ts-admin-route-service` depending on the file size.
In both error branches the request triggering the failure is a POST request.
