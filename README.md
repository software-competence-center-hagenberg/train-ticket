#### Original fault description

> **industrial fault description**:

> Symptom：
> The grid-loading process takes too much time
>
> Root Cause：
> Too many nested “select” and “from” clauses are in the constructed SQL statement
>
> **train_ticket replicated fault description**:
>
> To simulate the nested select clauses, one procedure of mysql to sleep 10s was created in ts-voucher-service.
> Since the front stage has a 5s limit of network request, the query of one order's voucher will be out of time.
>
> **fault replicate steps**:

> setup system:

#### Notes
Works as described. After step four, none of the links on the website work anymore. To get back, one has to use the back
button of the browser. (Tried out on Firefox and Edge)

As mentioned in the original description, the failure is implemented with a user-defined SQL function which solely
consists of a sleep statement. While the final effect, a delay, may be the same, the load profile of a long-running SQL
query and a SQL sleep are quite different.
