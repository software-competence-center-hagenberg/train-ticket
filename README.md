# Train Ticket：A Benchmark Microservice System
This is a fork of Trainticket from [FudanLab SE](https://github.com/FudanSELab/train-ticket), 
with revised error branches and instructions for setting up the system with the test case generator 
[EvoMaster](https://github.com/WebFuzzing/EvoMaster). 

For information on the system, adaptations and setup please visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/software-competence-center-hagenberg/train-ticket/wiki).
The individual branches contain a readme, describing the injected fault and necessary adaptions. The contents of these readmes and further details are available in the wiki.

The repository contains various versions of the Trainticket microservice system.
The master and ts-error-cleaned branch have no deliberately built-in faults, the remaining branches each
contain a deliberately built-in fault. The master branch and the fault branches
also differ from each other with regard to the underlying tech stack. Most notably:

| Component          | master branch      | fault branches                |
|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| Primary framework  | SpringBoot 2.3.12  | SpringBoot 1.5.3              |
| Persistence:       | One MySQL*         | Mostly individual MongoDBs    |
| Service discovery: | Spring Cloud Nacos | No                            |
| End user GUI:      | Yes                | No (just for testing purpose) |
| Admin GUI:         | Yes                | Yes                           |
