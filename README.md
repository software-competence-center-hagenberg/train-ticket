### ts-error-F1
#### Original fault description
> Industrial fault description:
>
> F1 is a fault that occurs in using asynchronous tasks in a single request, when we send messages asynchronously without message sequence control.
> Suppose we have Event A and Event B in a request, while Event A always processes and returns earlier than Event B.
> But sometimes, due to some specific reasons, Event A processes and returns later than Event B.
> Then F1 will occur.

> TrainTicket replicated fault description:
>
> In ticket-cancellation logic of the TrainTicket system, we have two major events: [Drawback Money] and [Reset Order Status].
> If the user decided to cancel an order, the Ticket-Cancel-Service firstly call Inside-Payment-Service to drawback money.
> Then Inside-Payment-Service call Order-Service to set the order status to CANCELLING.
> Then the system refunds the money to user.
> After that, the Cancel-Service call Order-Service set the order status to CANCEL.
> Then the whole cancel process is done.
> In our fault reproduction, we made a random delay in event [Drawback Money] to simulate the situation of network congestion.
> In this case, the event [Reset Order Stauts] will complete before [Drawback Money], then the fault occurs.
>
>
> Failure Triggering Usage Steps:
> 1. Log in and make sure that there is at least one ticket order that fits the following:
     (1) The train number starts with Z or K.
     (2) The order status is PAID.
> 2. Click [Flow Two - Ticket Cancel & Ticket Change].
> 3. Click [Refresh Orders].
> 4. Select the order mentioned above and click [Cancel Order].
> 5. Click [Confirm Cancel].
> 6. You will get result of cancel. If you get SUCCESS, it means the fault does not occur.
     >    If you get WRONG, it means the fault occurs, and you will see the exception logs on the server console.

> Failure Triggering Test Case:
>
> There is only one test case in ts-ui-test, named [TestFlowTwoCancel.java].
> Just run it and it will do as failure triggering usage steps mentioned above.


#### Notes

The description states that there is a random delay during [Drawback Money]. This functionality is implemented in
`AsyncTask` of `ts-cancel-service` and looks like this:

`````java
// Start of method drawBackMoneyForOrderCancel
double op = new Random().nextDouble();
if(op < 1.0){
        System.out.println("[Cancel Order Service] Delay Process，Wrong Cancel Process");
  Thread.sleep(8000);
} else {
        System.out.println("[Cancel Order Service] Normal Process，Normal Cancel Process");
}
// Actual functionality of method ...
// ...
`````

In order to assure that `AsyncTask` of `ts-cancel-service` is the only place where deliberate delays are introduced, we
searched for `Thread.sleep` and `sleep` in all source code files in this branch. Apart from hits in the test classes only
`AsyncTask` of `ts-cancel-service` introduces delays.

Although the above code snippet introduces delay, it does not do this at random. In fact, it always causes a delay, because
`op < 1.0` always evaluates to `true`, because `new Random().nextDouble()` produces random doubles in the range of
0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive).

To introduce a random 50:50 chance for either success or failure, we adapted the implementation with `new Random().nextBoolean()`.

Apart from this, the failure can be triggered as described.
