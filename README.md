#### Notes
**Clarification**: In the context of this system the term *voucher* has the meaning *receipt* or *invoice* and **not** *coupon* or *gift card*.

The original description, in conjunction with a specific interpretation of the term *voucher*, can lead to inability to
reproduce the failure. In the previous branches the descriptions contained in the "Document" directory were mostly correct.
But this time the steps to trigger the failure are wrong. The contents of the original readme on the other hand are incomplete,
because they lack information on the necessary preconditions which have to be fulfilled in order for the "Print Voucher"
button to appear. The correct steps are:

1. Log in.
2. Complete **all** steps in **Flow One - Ticket Reserve**. (Note: tripIds starting with **T** or **Z** are not able to finish all steps). Example journey: Shang Hai -> Su Zhou
3. Click [Flow Two - Ticket Cancel & Ticket Change].
4. Click [Refresh Orders].
5. Click **Print voucher** on the previously bought and used ticket.
6. The table on the next page should display 'Empty. No data!' instead of the actual ticket data.
7. (To get to the previous page, you have to use the 'Back' button of your browser.)
