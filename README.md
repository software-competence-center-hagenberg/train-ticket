#### Notes
It is hard to tell where the actual fault is, because on the entire page there are multiple places which could be
considered as faulty e.g. on the page `Flow One - Ticket Reserve`:
1. Login indicator: one time it shows as `== Login User ID4d2a46c7-71cb-4cf1-b5bb-b68406d9da6f` (probably the described
   fault). The other time it shows as `Login User ID == 4d2a46c7-71cb-4cf1-b5bb-b68406d9da6f`
2. On the entire page the section headings switch from flushed left to flushed right when pressing the button
   `Convert To RTL/LTR`.
3. In `Ticket Reserve Step 3 - Select Contacts`: The label of the `Need Food` checkbox is partially hidden by the checkbox.

This fault is different to the other faults, because this fault is a pure (CSS) style issue which has no connection to the
backend services.
