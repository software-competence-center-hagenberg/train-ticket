#### Notes
The correct way of calculating the ticket price is:

`price = distance * price_per_distance`

(The facto price_per_distance is different for comfort and economy class)

The factor `price_per_distance` can be configured by the application administrator. The comfort (first) and economy (second)
class tickets have different factors ranging from 0.2 to 0.7 for economy and 1.0 for comfort in the default configuration.
For one specific journey the factor for the comfort class is always higher than the factor for the economy class, leading to
the assertion:

`comfort_class_price > economy_class_price`


In the faulty implementation prices are calculated as:

`economy_class_price = distance`
`comfort_class_price = distance * comfort_price_per_distance`

The values for `comfort_price_per_distance` in the faulty implementation range from 0.8 to 1.3 (see ts-price-service: InitData).

| Train Type             | Price Per Distance |
|------------------------|--------------------|
| GaoTieOne, GaoTieTwo   | 1.3                |
| DongCheOne             | 1.2                |
| ZhiDa, TeKuai, KuaiSu  | 0.8                |

For the suggested journey from Shanghai to Su Zhou there are only trains of type GaoTieOne and GaoTieTwo, which makes it
difficult to spot the error without further domain knowledge, because the price of the comfort class ticket is still higher
than the economy class ticket. In order to clearly see the failure one has to search for tickets from **Shang Hai -> Nan Jing**
or vice versa. There the assertion `comfort_class_price > economy_class_price` does not hold for the train type ZhiDa.


Note on code source: Branch ts-error-F14 of fault replication git repo seems to be the version distributed as zip archive.
