>
> **train_ticket replicated fault description**:
>
> Just add the aria label in the login module.
> There are three input types to read —  Email, Password and Verification Code.
> When the cursor focuses on the input, the screen reader will read the value in it.
> Add the "aria-labelledby" label to the "Email" and "Password" inputs to first read the input name,
> so that user can make clear what the input value represent.
> But the "Verification Code" input doesn't add an "aria-labelledby" label
> So user will just heard the input's default value "abcd", it will confuse the user.
>

> fault reproduce manually step:
>
> 1. Click [Flow one - Ticket Reserve]
> 2. Click [Tab] and focus the Email input, the screen reader will read the label and default value of this row
> 3. Continue click [Tab] until cursor focuses on the Verification Code row,
     > since it misses a "aria-labelledby" label, the screen reader will not read the "Verification Code" string.
>

#### Notes
Email and password input fields have an `aria-labelelledby` attribute while the input for the verification code lacks one.
Behaviour with screen reader not tested.
